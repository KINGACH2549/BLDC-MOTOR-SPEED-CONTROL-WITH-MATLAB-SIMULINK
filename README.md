# BLDC-MOTOR-SPEED-CONTROL-WITH-MATLAB-SIMULINK
This is a project made to show how to control speed of BLDC motor using Matlab simulink 
Motors are the main source of mechanical energy in 
todayâ€™s world for most of the tasks. Motors are running many 
manufacturing industries around the world and is also a source 
of electricity when used as a generator but the problem with the 
motors is that their mechanical components die out with time and 
the required efficiency for long term usage because most of the 
motors in use are brushed motors where due to excessive 
operations of brushes they loose their contacts with armature and 
motors fail to operate so in this report we present brushless 
motor that is an electronic motor which is controlled 
electronically and needs no mechanical support for its operation . 
In this report a basic simulation of Brushless D.C Motor (BLDC) 
will be presented using MATLAB Simulink. This report provides 
an outlook using MATLAB Simulink how BLDC motors are 
useful over Brushed D.C. Motors
